A Game of Chance

You have the opportunity to play the game that is described below.

You'll get to play the game a total of 10 times and your goal is to earn the highest score you can.

You will be paid an amount equal to the points you score! 

What is the best possible strategy for playing?

The game: A computer internally generates (it does not show them to you) two random whole numbers between 0 and 100, called X and Y. The computer then reveals the value of X to you. You then guess whether Y is highe or lower than X.
    - If you are correct, you earn Y points.
    - If you are incorrect, you earn 0 points.

Example:

The computer shows you the number 40 (this is X):
    - You guess that Y is higher
        You are correct! The actual value of Y is 67, and so you earn 67 points.

The computer shows you the number 32 (this is X):
    - You guess that Y is higher
        You are incorrect. The actual value of Y is 12, and so you earn 0 points.

The computer shows you the number 70 (this is X):
    - You guess that Y is higher
        You are correct! The actual value of Y is 13, and so you earn 13 points.
